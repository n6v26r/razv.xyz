## Operating System

My OS of choice is <i class="fa-brands fa-linux"></i>. I have tried in multiple distros but prefer <span style="font-family:'Nerd Font'">󰣇</span>&nbsp based, mainly for the os freedom and for the AUR.

I've used Arch, EndeavourOS, Pop!_OS, and Debian, and ultimately settled on Manjaro.
People say NixOS is the great new thing so mabye I'll try that too in the future. 

<Alert type="controversial">

 Am am going to get a lot of hate for this, but I actually think Manjaro is a good distro.

 I know the main issue haters claim is that holding back updates, like Manjaro does, causes instability. In my experience that is not the case, even with heavy AUR use.

 Yes, the devs forgot to renew some security certificates ~~a lot of~~ a few times.
 Yes, they have done some stupid mistakes.
 Idc, the OS works for me :) And if some day it doesn't, I'll find another option then.

## GUI
I manily use i3 because it's tiny and cool, and I like that it uses <span style="font-family:'Nerd Font'">\<=</span>300mb of ram. When in need of wayland (on devices with weird resolutions), I use sway or hyprland if I'm feeling like a script kiddie. I would love to try dwm when I find enough time to set it up and rice it to oblivion.

Also KDE is trash. If you need a full DE (which you don't) use Gnome.

Ultimately, my only GUI needs are a browser and a music player :(

## Programs

Cool, very fast, terminal with a ton of features.

Neovim but better.

Quite slow, but I don't really have a better alternative.

Really cool app with an ad blocker built in + plugins and custom css support.
