This is going to be a bit of a rant about the current state of digital human interconnection, if you can even call it that.

## The problem

The state of online platforms today is saddening at best. They have shifted away from being unbounded networks of real connection and have become a soul-sucking void of meaningless affirmation[^1]. The idealistic web that gave everyone a voice to express themselves and their ideas is now fading.

Instead, we're being cluelessly manipulated by increasingly smarter algorithms created to do one thing: generate engagement at any cost. You are no longer the consumer; you are the product!

Don't get me wrong, we manipulate each other every day! By sharing opinions and ideas, we persuade the ones around us. That's a core part of being human. However, this does become an ethical issue when it's not done transparently and reciprocally by us (people), but it's algorithms (and, by extension, the rich and evil[^2]) doing it.

A person's influence has limits. They are one mind, with one perspective. An algorithm, however, can collect ungodly amounts of data about you and use it to exploit your psychology in the most niche, perverted ways. You don't know what posts are being promoted to your feed, which ones are hidden from you, or how the system is guiding your behavior.
Not to mention the recent trend of "AI"[^4] features.

## The illusion of choice

I would be a hypocrite if I didn't try to minimize the presence of such apps in my life. Unfortunately, these days, having accounts on certain platforms is a social requirement. Try telling a person in Eastern Europe they can't contact you on WhatsApp because you don't have it... **by choice**.

I am unfortunately no saint and still dependent on some of those evil apps for my online life. But I am trying to ditch as many of them as possible (perhaps replacing them with good alternatives), and I can only strongly encourage you to do the same.

## Some alternatives

There are exceptions to every rule. Unfortunately, nobody is "crazy enough"[^5] to use them. :[

Some of my favorites include:
- Mastodon, an open-source Twitter (X) alternative. Out of all the good platforms I've seen so far, I think this one has the most potential to actually go mainstream. 
- Element (Matrix) is an alternative to WhatsApp/Telegram and Discord.
- Signal is the obvious choice for secure communication. (No one seems to use it, though.)
- Honorable mentions: 
  - [Cyberspace](https://cyberspace.online) is a new "de-imagined" quiet little social place, full of cool people.

## A solution?

In order for a platform to exist and function, it needs money, and it has three main ways to get it:
- sell user data (to third parties including but not limited to advertisers)
- ask an upfront price from the user
- rely on voluntary donations

The first one is obviously the most profitable and ethically unacceptable, and while paying for a service you use sounds perfectly reasonable in theory, social dynamics will not allow such a business model to scale.

This leaves us with the third option, which can work but only with a dedicated community and usually with decentralized platforms, where server hosting isn't that much of a problem (see Mastodon).

So what do we do? How do we dethrone the money-hungry overlords of our online social existence?

We live in a world where our own governments are trying to spy on us. Even the EU continues to promote proposals that would weaken secure communication. (and is calling this idiocy "child protection") GDPR is becoming less of a protection for the citizens' privacy and more of a **slight** annoyance for data hoarders.

Google's slogan used to be "Don't be evil."
In 2015 they replaced it with "Do the right thing."
The right thing for whom?

Given the current state of things, we can either hope that our manipulators will sabotage themselves (which they ironically seem to be doing a lot of lately) or start seriously considering our digital autonomy.
